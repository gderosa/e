\emph{Idea}. Sean Carroll on \term{YouTube}\footnote{ \url{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-ct1IlGUOw}. }
may benefit from the Page--Wootters (P--W) model. He assumes time, and let space emerge.
P--W assumes space, and let time emerge. From entanglement in both case. Important difference
is that there is no interaction Hamiltonin in P--W (between the ``clock'' and the ``rest'').
It's a matter of choosing the most ``appropriate'' decomposition. Carroll: weak field regime,
no black holes, Big Bang, etc. but that is okay for now.

Add numeric examples?

TODO: more precise citations.

Quantum simulation of GR? Analogy? Graphene? Optical lattices? BEC?

Thermodynamics, irreversibility, arrow of time? Carroll suggests to be cautious though.
